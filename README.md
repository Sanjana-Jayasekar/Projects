## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify the factors that influence churn rate in telecom industry and to provide recommendation on how to control the churn rate.

## Project Description
The project involved	Building a predictive model that would predict if a customer will churn or not based on the past telecom customer data to perform trend analysis.	Developed 
logistic regression and decision tree with both full grown and pruned models for classification purpose. Logistic regression models were created with variables of different 
signicance levels for deeper understanding of the data works. Used AUC- ROC score to evaluate the models and finalized on logistic regression as it showed a high AUC_ROC score
of 82.3%.
